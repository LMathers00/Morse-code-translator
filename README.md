# Morse-code-translator

<!-- spec -->
Translator functions and Unit tests to be written in separate files. Functions to be brought into the main.js and unit test files.
You need to have it as a public repository on GitHub.
In the repo you will also need a README.md with a short intro to the project.
We expect at least 10 Git commits for the different stages in your development.
Beware of following a “How to.. JS tutorial”. Watching a video is not the same as learning to code. Some of the stuff you’ll have to do we
won’t have covered so If you can’t explain it or don’t understand it, you can’t use it.
We would like you to take a Mobile first approach to the implementation. It needs to work on different device widths.

<!-- Pseudo code -->
So we need it to translate English => Morse 
So we need a 1 to 1 alphabet translation 
where it takes the string and for each word returns the morse equivalent (need to change all to lowercase)
for numbers need to change from number to string and then return the morse equuivalent 
need to replicate string spaces 

Firstly need to to decare the morse alphabet
