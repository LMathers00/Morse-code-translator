# Morse-code-translator
<!-- Pseudo code -->
So we need it to translate English => Morse 
So we need a 1 to 1 alphabet translation 
where it takes the string and for each word returns the morse equivalent (need to change all to lowercase)
for numbers need to change from number to string and then return the morse equuivalent 
need to replicate string spaces with forward slashes

Firstly need to to decare the morse alphabet
then call to that alphabet to do a one to one swap 


Morse to english is abit trickier however as there isn't a set length for for the string 
like for example "---" could be both s and mt
